                <ul>
                    <li>3 weeks of high volume training</li>
                    <li>You will be exhausted at times until your body adjusts. Do the specified volume anyway, but make adjustments if necessar as noted below.</li>
                    <li>The first week is the most difficult since the volume is the highest and your body is the least prepared for it. The good
                        thing is that at the start of a cyle, you should not have any accumulated fatigue from the previous weeks.
                    </li>
                    <li>Do not add any additional exercises / volume to your week or you will lose your gains.</li>
                    <li>The intensity is mostly low, but you will feel the effect of the previous workouts on each subsequent workout,
                        so even the lighter weights may feel heavy.
                    </li>
                    <li>In general, you will need to learn to distiguish between the pain of soreness and the pain of injury. Never work through injury (although
                        ask your coach for an alternative to work <em>around</em> it if possible.
                    </li>

                        Dealing with failed reps
                        <p>During high volume training, failing to complete a rep isn't unusual, but you must adapt the movement to be able to complete
                            the specified volume. The number of reps you perform always takes priority over the intensity (amount of weight). So to complete
                            the required reps, use the following strategy:
                            <ul>
                                <li>If you get to the point where you cannot perform any of the reps, lower the intensity 5-10%.</li>
                                <li>If you feel like you cannot do another snatch, do a snatch pull instead.</li>
                                <li>If you feel like you cannot do another jerk, do a jerk drive instead.</li>
                                <li>If you feel like you cannot do another clean, do a clean pull instead.</li>
                                <li>Missed reps count towards the volume, so don't repeat a missed rep unless you Clarked it and feel like
                                    you didn't expend any energy doing so.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                    </li>
