                <ul>
                  <li>Sunday is heavy day so we can sync up with the Sunday meet day.</li>
                  <li>We are mostly focused on the classical lifts, so there is not much
                    variety in the exercise selection.
                  </li>
                  <li>The purpose of going from 87% to 70% to 90% is to simulate a long
                    wait between competition platform attempts. The athlete has to get comfortable with a long
                    wait between the last heavy attempt at 87 and will need to focus on reproducing
                    the same technique on the 90% attempt as the prior 70% attempt.
                  </li>
                  <li>When you don't practice taking lighter attempts to stay warm during long waits between
                    attempts on the competition platform, you will have to take heavy pulls or heavy
                    snatches / C&J's instead. The latter method has the advantage of keeping the athlete neurally primed for the
                    competition attempts due to the specificity of the weights, without having to do any special training
                    during the macrocycle, but at the expensive of extra competition fatigue which
                    will reduce power output. Athletes who train for large jumps during their macrocycles
                    will be able to stay neurally primed for long waits and maintain both technique and power
                    once it is their turn on the platform.

                <summary>Athlete Notes</summary>
                <ul>
                    <li>Volume is very low and intensity is high.</li>
                    <li>This week fatigue is deliberately reduced as you are peaking for meet day.</li>
                    <li>Do not add additional reps / exercises even if you feel like you can do more. That includes
                        non-weightlifting related activities outside of your team workouts.
                    </li>
                    <li>You may feel that the weights & volume are not challenging enough to feel like you got a good workout. 
                        This is expected. Avoid the temptation to add more to your workouts to get the post-workout high
                        which is normally the result of strenuously exerting yourself.
                    </li>
                    <li>When you perform the 70% lifts that come just before the 90% lifts, focus on producing technically
                        perfect lifts. When you perform the 90% lifts, approach the bar exactly the same way and reproduce
                        the movements you did @70%. At this point in the cycle, the main challenge of a 90% lift isn't
                        power or strength, but being able to consistently use the same technique you use for lighter weights.
