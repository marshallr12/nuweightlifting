                <ul>
                  <li>Sunday is a very long workout, so encourage people to finish their warmups before
                    the session starts, and to switch athletes efficiently between turns.
                  </li>
                  <li>Thursday is a long workout too, although not as long as Sunday's workout.</li>
                  <li>Athletes who miss Sunday's workout due to the competition should perform that workout
                    on Tuesday instead. The originally programmed workout for Tuesday should be skipped / discarded. If
                    they are still feeling trashed after the meet by Tuesday, they can do the originally
                    programmed workout for Tuesday.
                  </li>
                  <li>Missed lifts: generally should not be repeated because they still cause significant fatigue, so still count
                    towards the volume. Repeating a missed lift might be ok when: (a) the intensity is <= 55%, (b) the bar didn't
                    get past the athlete's knees, e.g., "Clarked". A missed lift can cause psychological fatigue even when
                    the intensity is low or the athlete "Clarked," so the default action should be to count the lift towards
                    the volume unless you observe that the athlete seems unfazed by the miss, in which case repeating a missed attempt
                    may be OK.

                <ul>
                    <li>Very high volume. This is the most difficult week of the Macrocycle due to the combination
                        of high volume and high intensity.
                    </li>
                    <li>Reduced accessory work due to the high volume of weightlifting movements.</li>
                    <li>Sunday's workout is the most difficult workout of the Macrocycle. Not everyone will be
                        able to complete it as programmed.
                    </li>
                    <li>You will probably be unable to complete the workout if you did not eat well or sleep well before training, or
                        did other athletics last week.</li>

                        <li>@65%, you may already start wondering if you're capable of doing much more. Try to ignore those thoughts and keep
                            a "wait and see" attitude.
                        </li>
                        <li>If you are certain you cannot complete a clean, pull it instead.</li>
                        <li>If you are certain you cannot complete a jerk, perform a jerk drive instead.</li>
                        <li>If you cannot properly complete more than one rep on a set, reduce the weight 5-10% on the next set. Finishing the 
                            programmed volume is much more important than finishing at the programmed intensity.
                        </li>
