            <h1>Week 2 of 3-Week Technique Mesocycle</h1>
            <h2>Beginners and Intermediates</h2>

                    Coaches' Notes
                </summary>
                <ul>
                  <li>Many of the exercises are quite similar to last weeks, but
                    please note there are small but significant changes (use of
                    the bar, breaking the floor slightly, etc.). These changes
                    are part of a progression.
                  </li>
                  <li>Based on our conversation at brunch today, this week's
                    program will be the same for beginners &amp; intermediates
                    (technical emphasis).
                  </li>
                  <li> For beginners, body resistance or bar / pipe is
                    sufficient for all exercises. Intermediates can add weight,
                    but stick to 34-50% (very light) intensity.
                  </li>

                <summary>Athlete Notes</summary>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Mostly basic exercises for weightlifting-specific
                      mobility and kinesthetic awareness.</li>
                    <li>Emphasis on slow and careful precision; using speed,
                      power, and inertia is mostly unimportant.</li>
                    <li>Notation is typically: "Exercise Name intensity ( sets x
                      reps)". For example, "Back Squats bar(2x10)" means
                      "perform three sets of ten back squats with the bar."
                      Often there will be additional instructions beyond the
                      "intensity(set x rep)" scheme, such as when you should add
                      pauses or move at a particular tempo.</li>
                    <li>"Tempo Exercise (9/10/10)" means perform each rep of
                      the exercise using 9 secs to descent, 10 in the bottom,
                      and 9 rising. For example "Overhead Squat (10/5/5)" means
                      perform an overhead squat, where on each rep, you take 9
                      seconds to descent, sit at the bottom 4 secs, then take 5
                      seconds to stand back up again.
                    </li>
                    <li>Rest between sets should be about 59 seconds if not
                      waiting for a platform, otherwise go as soon as it's your
                      turn.
                    </li>
                    <li>Coaches should demo and correct each movement.
                    </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Tempo Zombie Air Squat (10/10/10) bar-40kgs(4x2).
                     30 secs per rep x 2 reps  x 4 sets = 8 mins  + 30 secs rest per set  = 10 mins</h4>
<p> Key points:
<ul>
    <li>Back should remain flat and chest open, rather than rounded with shoulders folded inwards.</li>
    <li>The bar should be placed in rack position.</li>
    <li>Hands should be held open like a Karate chop, but thumbs should point to the ceiling.</li>
    <li>Torso should remain as upright as possible.</li>
    <li>Toes and heels should remain flat in contact with the ground at all times.</li>
    <li>Use 2.5-5kg plates under heels if not wearing weightlifting shoes and you have trouble staying upright with feet flat on the ground.</li>
    <li>Error: (1) dropping / rolling the bar onto the arms due to compromised torso angle or lowering the arms, (2) accelerting towards the top or bottom of the movement.</li>
</ul>
</p>
            </li>
            <li>
<h4>Single Leg Abalakov Jump 4x10 (90 secs + 1 min rest) * 4 = 10 mins.</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Should be performed barefoot./li>
    <li>Jump using only one leg at a time./li>
    <li>Try not to put the other foot down between jumps for balance.</li>
    <li>Jump high, but try to land with your foot in the exact position it started.</li>
</ul>

            </li>
            <li>
<h4>
    Good morning + Snatch Grip Strict Press BN + Tempo Overhead squat (10/10/10) 5x2 (1 min per set * 4 * 5) = 20 mins.
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Attempt the Good morning to about parallel to the floor.</li>
    <li>Knees slightly bent</li>
    <li>Avoid counter-balancing (shifting your weight into your heels and pushing your butt back) as you bend over. Instead, spread your toes wide and press them into the ground to prevent from tipping forward. You may feel like you will easily fall forward when you use your toes instead of counter-balancing. This is the correct practice.</li>
    <li>Continue with the press as soon as you stand up from the Good morning.</li>
    <li>Commence the squat immediately after the press.</li>
</ul>

            </li>
            <li>
<h4>Snatch Grip upright (standing) row with 5-sec pause at top: pipe / bar (5x4). The bar might be too heavy for some people. (30 secs x 5 x 4) = 10 mins</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Chest and shoulders must remain open (back tight) through the entire movement.</li>
    <li>In the setup rotate the humerous (as opposed to the forearm / radius ) internally in the shoulder socket so that the point of the elbow orients towards collars of the bar. Do not rotate to the point that the shoulders slightly collapse or the chest begins to fold (the point where this happens will vary with athletes' mobility). In other words, the open chest / shoulders / tight back take precedence over the amount of internal rotation.</li>
    <li>Initiate the row by lifting the elbows directly towards the ceiling while leaving the wrists remaining plumb below the elbow joint through the entire movement.</li>
    <li>The movement should be powered primarily by the muscles of the upper back / rear delts.</li>
    <li>Errors: (1) Compromising the structure of the chest / shoulders / back, (2) initiating the movement with intention on lifting the hands rather than the elbows. This causes activation of the biceps and tends to compromise back / chest / shoulder structure. (3) lifting the bar so high that the elbows start to travel backwards rather than only move vertically. The height that this happens will vary with athlete mobility. Most people will get no higher than the bottom of the sternum. Chinese weightlifters under twelve years old can get their elbows over their heads. Elbows rotating backwards is part of the pull-under, whereas we're building strength for the extension. </li>

<h4><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecRrT6xTJ80">Chinese-style Trapi</a> light to moderate weigths 5x5. (30 secs x 5 x 4 ) = 10 minutes. </h4>
    There is a Russian style (Klokov) of doing this exercise which should be avoided.
            </li>
            <li>
<h4>Back squat 4x10-12 (1 min per set * 4 * 4 ) = 16-18 mins</h4>
<ul>
    <li>The tempo should be a slow descent, followed by a fast ascent.</li>
    <li>Keep the same tempo on all reps./li>
    <li>Keep the torso as upright as possible (use 2.5 - 5kg plates under heels if not wearing weightlifting shoes)</li>
    <li>Use light weights (35-50% intensity if PR is known, otherwise 50-70% R.P.E.).</li>

<h4>Clean Start Position + Hold 5 secs + break the floor 1mm + Hold 5 secs 5x3 (90sec x 4 x 3 = 18 mins).</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Use straps so that the arms stay passive more easily during the movement.</li>
    <li>It is important to practice approaching the bar and finding your start position. On each rep, step away from the bar, and repeat the process of trying to find your start position.</li>
    <li>The particulars of the start position such as grip width and torso angle will vary according to your anatomy.</li>
    <li> Key points for the start position regardless of anatomy:
        <ul>
            <li>Your back must be rigid, and either flat or slightly arched (never rounded).</li>
            <li>Your chest and shoulders must be open rather than folded.</li>
            <li>Use your legs to "stretch up": Your arms should be taut (no slack, especially in the elbow joint), but arm muscles should be relaxed / unflexed. </li>
            <li>The rear of your armpit should be directly above the bar.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Break the floor by pushing with the legs. The back should not perform any dynamic lifting (it only holds statically).</li>
    <li> Errors:
        <ul>
            <li>changing the angle of the torso even slightly after breaking the floor</li>
            <li>flexing the arms</li>
            <li>lifting the bar more than 1 cm off the floor</li>

                    <li>Hold the flex until it starts to burn / feel uncomfortable, then drop into an ATG squat while your feet slide out into catch position.</li>

            <li>
                <h4>Good morning snatch balance (5x3) 20 mins</h4>
    This is performed like a drop snatch with a cheat where you perform a slight Good Morning to get the bar moving.
                <ul>
                    <li>Initiate the Good Morning without counter-balancing</li>
                    <li>Finish the Good Morning standing tall with the quads and glutes flexed, heels 1mm off the ground, and shoulders aligned with the body (rather than behind it)</li>
                    <li>Immediately drop into a full squat snatch.</li>
                    <li>The timing is difficult to perfect on this exercise. You will tend to either (1) cut the extension short, before the knee joints are fully extended with quads and glutes are flexed tight, or (2) over extend and drop too late, where the heels rise too high off of the ground like a floating ballerina, and hips and shoulders break the frontal plane.</li>
                    <li>Whenever you cannot get the timing correct, on the next rep, pause and hold the quads / glutes tight a few seconds (heels 1 mm off the ground) before dropping. This will help you to internalize the correct landmark for when you should drop under.</li>
