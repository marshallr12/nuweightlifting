                <ul>
                    <li>3 weeks of high volume training</li>
                    <li>You will be exhausted at times until your body adjusts</li>
                    <li>The first week is the most difficult since the volume is the highest and your body is the least prepared for it. The good
                        thing is that at the start of a cyle, you should not have any accumulated fatigue from the previous weeks.
                    </li>
                    <li>The intensity is mostly low, but you will feel the effect of the previous workouts on each subsequent workout,
                        so even the lighter weights may feel heavy.
                    </li>
                    <li>In general, you will need to learn to distinguish between the pain of soreness and the pain of injury. Never work through injury (although
                        ask your coach for an alternative to work <em>around</em> it if possible.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Since you may not know your 1 rep max, choose weights that allow you to perform the movement correctly. Always prioritize
                        angles / timing / technique over speed and power. Generally, use weights that are a 5-7 in difficulty on the first rep of each set. Use a scale of 1-10, where 
                        1="I'm Captain America - I could do this all day" and 10="I could possibly Hulk smash 1 rep at most." On basic strength movements like squat,
                        you can go heavier if you feel like it.
