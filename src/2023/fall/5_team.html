                  <li>Watch for failed attempts on the classic or power lifts. Athletes who fail on the 2nd
                    rep due to fatigue should either decrease the weight on the next set (5-10%) on at least
                    not increase the weight.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Power Snatch 60(2x3) 65(2x3) 70(2x3) 75x3</h4>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Clean Grip Overhead Partial OverHead Squat + Drop PJ bar(4x3)</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This exercise will help you find the feel of <em>yielding with your legs</em>
                        to complete a jerk rather than relying entirely on pressing the weight up</li>
                        <li>With a clean grip, press the bar from behind your neck until your arms are fully extended 
                            for the start position of the overhead squat</li>
                        <li>Maintain the position of the bar overhead, and then squat down about 20-30% of your height</li>
                        <li>Stand back up, lower the bar to behind your neck, then press the bar up from behind your neck
                            until it is a little above your head. Hold the bar fixed in that position.
                        </li>
                        <li>Quickly drop under the bar until your arms are fully extended. <strong>When you drop under, the bar musn't
                            rise higher than the starting fixed position</strong>. In other words, think of pressing yourself down rather
                        than pressing the bar up.</li>
                        <li>As you drop under, your feet should slide out to the catch width for a clean, and no wider.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>PC + 2PJ 60x3 65x3 70x2 75x2 80(2x2)</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each rep is composed of one clean + two power jerks, so you will do six jerks on a set of three reps.</li>
                        <li>On each jerk drive, make sure your have fully extended at the knee joint by forcefully flexing your quads
                            and glutes, then immediately relax and rebend your knees. Do not wait until your are on your "tippy toes"
                            to rebend your knees; you don't need to be a ballerina "en pointe."
                        </li>
                        <li>There should be no point in the jerk where your legs stay motionless (extended) while your arms continue to 
                            extend (press) the bar up. <strong>Any moment that your arms are extending, your legs should still be rebending.</strong>
                        </li>
                        <li>Since the use of gravity is "free" energy, learning to drop under the bar means you will be able to complete
                            more reps without tiring out and pressing out. However, dropping under can be psychologically difficult because one's instinct
                            under stress is to push harder, rather than yield more.
                        </li>
                        <li>Instinct can be overcome by correctly practicing a movement with enough repetition while fatigued. When fatigued,
                            you can't "think things through," so the motor pattern you practice trains your autonomic nervous system, which is responsible
                            for reflexes.
                        </li>
                        <li>On each rep, try to find the feeling of yielding your legs while you extend your arms. Even if you aren't successful,
                            your intention will eventually produce results after much practice and fatigue.
