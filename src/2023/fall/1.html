                <ul>
                  <li>Based on our conversation at brunch today, this week's program will be the same for beginners & intermediates (technical emphasis).</li>
                  <li>I've added total time estimates for an exercise in italics, assuming some exercises require four people to take turns on a platform. Others (like air squats) I assume everyone can go at the same time.</li>
                  <li>I don't know if my estimates are going to be accurate, so please let me know how long each session actually takes. There will probably be time used use to take turns, load plates, chat, give instructions, etc. which I can't accurately account for.</li>
                  <li>For beginners, body resistance or bar / pipe is sufficient for all exercises. Intermediates can add weight, but stick to 35-50% (very light) intensity.</li>
                </ul>
            </details>

                <ul>
                    <li>Mostly basic exercises for weightlifting-specific mobility and kinesthetic awareness.</li>
                    <li>Emphasis on slow and careful precision; using speed, power, and inertia is mostly unimportant.</li>
                    <li>Notation is typically: "Exercise Name  intensity( sets x reps)". For example, "Back Squats bar(3x10)" means "perform three sets of ten back squats with the bar." Often there will be additional instructions beyond the "intensity(set x rep)" scheme, such as when you should add pauses or move at a particular tempo.</li>
                    <li>"Tempo Exercise (10/10/10)" means perform each rep of the exercise using 10 secs to descent, 10 in the bottom, and 10 rising. For example "Overhead Squat (10/5/5)" means perform an overhead squat, where on each rep, you take 10 seconds to descent, sit at the bottom 5 secs, then take 5 seconds to stand back up again.</li>
                    <li>Rest between sets should be about 60 seconds if not waiting for a platform, otherwise go as soon as it's your turn.</li>
                    <li>Coaches should demo and correct each movement</li>
                </ul>

                        <li>Back should remain flat and chest open, rather than rounded with shoulders folded inwards.</li>
                        <li>Torso should remain as upright as possible.</li>
                        <li> Toes and heels should remain flat in contact with the ground at all times.</li>
                        <li>Use 2.5-5kg plates under heels if not wearing weightlifting shoes and you have trouble staying upright with feet flat on the ground</li>

                        <li>Beginners should use a pipe, intermediates can use a pipe or bumper plates at most up to 35-40kg</li>

                        <li>Avoid counter-balancing (shifting your weight into your heels and pushing your butt back) as you bend over. Instead, spread your toes wide and press them into the ground to prevent from tipping forward. You may feel like you will easily fall forward when you use your toes instead of counter-balancing. This is the correct practice. </li>
                        <li>Continue with the press as soon as you stand up from the Good morning.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>It is important to practice approaching the bar and finding your start position. On each rep, step away from the bar, and repeat the process of trying to find your start position.</li>
                        <li>The particulars of the start position such as grip width and torso angle will vary according to your anatomy.</li>
                        <li>Key points for the start position regardless of anatomy:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Your back must be rigid, and either flat or slightly arched (never rounded).</li>
                                <li>Your chest and shoulders must be open rather than folded.</li>
                                <li>Use your legs to "stretch up": Your arms should be taut (no slack, especially in the elbow joint), but arm muscles should be relaxed / unflexed.</li>
                                <li>The rear of your armpit should be directly above the bar.</li>
                            </ul>

                        <li>Perform a slight dip, then stand tall with quads and glutes flexed hard, heels 1mm off the ground.</li>
                        <li>Hold the flex until it starts to burn / feel uncomfortable, then drop into an ATG squat while your feet slide out into catch position.</li>
                        <li>Try to land rock bottom rather than catch the squat high and slowly ride to the bottom.</li>
                        <li>more difficult for tall people with long femurs.</li>
