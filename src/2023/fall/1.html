                <ul>
                  <li>Based on our conversation at brunch today, this week's program will be the same for beginners & intermediates (technical emphasis).</li>
                  <li>I've added total time estimates for an exercise in italics, assuming some exercises require four people to take turns on a platform. Others (like air squats) I assume everyone can go at the same time.</li>
                  <li>I don't know if my estimates are going to be accurate, so please let me know how long each session actually takes. There will probably be time used use to take turns, load plates, chat, give instructions, etc. which I can't accurately account for.</li>
                  <li>For beginners, body resistance or bar / pipe is sufficient for all exercises. Intermediates can add weight, but stick to 35-50% (very light) intensity.</li>
                </ul>
            </details>

                <ul>
                    <li>Mostly basic exercises for weightlifting-specific mobility and kinesthetic awareness.</li>
                    <li>Emphasis on slow and careful precision; using speed, power, and inertia is mostly unimportant.</li>
                    <li>Notation is typically: "Exercise Name  intensity( sets x reps)". For example, "Back Squats bar(3x10)" means "perform three sets of ten back squats with the bar." Often there will be additional instructions beyond the "intensity(set x rep)" scheme, such as when you should add pauses or move at a particular tempo.</li>
                    <li>"Tempo Exercise (10/10/10)" means perform each rep of the exercise using 10 secs to descent, 10 in the bottom, and 10 rising. For example "Overhead Squat (10/5/5)" means perform an overhead squat, where on each rep, you take 10 seconds to descent, sit at the bottom 5 secs, then take 5 seconds to stand back up again.</li>
                    <li>Rest between sets should be about 60 seconds if not waiting for a platform, otherwise go as soon as it's your turn.</li>
                    <li>Coaches should demo and correct each movement</li>
                </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Back should remain flat and chest open, rather than rounded with shoulders folded inwards.</li>
                        <li>Torso should remain as upright as possible.</li>
                        <li> Toes and heels should remain flat in contact with the ground at all times.</li>
                        <li>Use 2.5-5kg plates under heels if not wearing weightlifting shoes and you have trouble staying upright with feet flat on the ground</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Beginners should use a pipe, intermediates can use a pipe or bumper plates at most up to 35-40kg</li>
                        <li>Each person goes twice, about two minutes practice each time = 16-20 mins</li>

                        <li>Knees slightly bent</li>
                        <li>Avoid counter-balancing (shifting your weight into your heels and pushing your butt back) as you bend over. Instead, spread your toes wide and press them into the ground to prevent from tipping forward. You may feel like you will easily fall forward when you use your toes instead of counter-balancing. This is the correct practice. </li>
                        <li>Continue with the press as soon as you stand up from the Good morning.</li>

                        <li>The movement is performed slowly primarily to train your core stability, secondarily to build muscular endurance.</li>
                        <li>Secondarily, slow / static exercises help you to internalize important positional landmarks in the movements.</li>
