                  <li>If you have athletes that PR during the macrocycle (including at a meet), they should
                    continue to calculate their relative intensities based on their PR's at the beginning
                    of the cycle. The pattern of volume and intensity as the macrocycle progresses already presumes
                    that athletes will improve their strength and conditioning relative to when they started.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If you calculate intensities based on a new PR before the macrocyle ends, the athlete will tend
                    to overtrain and regress.
                  </li>
                  <li>New PR's should be used at the start of the <em>next</em> cycle.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>A snatch extension is a snatch pull that is complete as soon as your legs
                            are fully extended (quads and glutes flexed, heels still on the ground or barely off the ground)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            After your legs have finished their job, leave your arms unactivated / relaxed, i.e., do not
                            use your arms or any part of your upper body to lift the bar further as with a high pull
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If you are aggresive enough with your legs during the extension, you will generate excess upward energy
                            that should be dispersed by allowing your shoulders to rise upwards. This will appear externally
                            like a shrug, but it is a passive action rather than a deliberate lifting of the shoulders via
                            flexing / contracting your traps. Your traps should not contribute to the upward energy of the bar;
                            your shoulders just go along for the ride.
                        </li>
                        <li>Any time you do a snatch movement, it is beneficial to
                            sit in the catch 3-5 seconds before recovering. You
                            will gain more out of each rep and progress more quickly this way.
