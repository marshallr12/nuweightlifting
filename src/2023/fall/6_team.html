                    <li>About 18% less volume than last week, but average intensity is higher.</li>
                    <li>Sam should demo the Boston method of wrist fixation overhead.</li>
                    <li>Sam should also demo how to find the minimum bar height to receive a clean, but
                        athletes can pair up and find the actual height themselves after viewing
                        the demo.

                    <h4>Demo: Boston method of overhead wrist alignment</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Athletes should be in Malasana Pose while observing the demo</li>
                        <li>General note: for some technical issues in weightlifting, you will find
                            coaches at opposite spectrums. As a consumer of weightlifting media,
                            it's important to realize that often people will religiously advocate
                            a particular method for a few potential reasons:
                            <ul>
                                <li>They weren't actually taught a particular method, so only teach
                                    what came instinctively and worked for them.
                                </li>
                                <li>They learned and coach only one method, so aren't educated
                                    and have never tried or coached alternatives. The majority
                                    of coaches who insist their method is the one true method
                                    won't admit they are uneducated about something. This includes
                                    many "famous" coaches.
                                </li>
                                <li>You should try to identify both the strenths and weaknesses
                                    of conflicting methods.
                                </li>
                                <li>What's more important is that you eventually pick a particular
                                    method and stick with it. Consistent practice with a particular method
                                    is usually a better investment than frequently changing your
                                    basic technique.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>If not otherwise coached, most people will
                            hyper flex their wrists in the overhead position.
                        </li>
                        <li>The Boston method is healthier on your wrists, but more difficult to 
                            learn and stabilize than the hyperflexion method. The hyperflexion method
                            puts more stress on your connective tissues and requires you to contend with
                            additional forces that can cause you to lose a lift behind you.
                        </li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Demo: Minimum bar height to receive clean</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The higher you lift the bar (regardless of the lift), the more power is required to successfully
                            complete the same weight.</li>
                        <li>A good strategy is to learn to be able to get under the bar at the lowest height possible. Otherwise
                            the only way to lift more weight is to keep getting stronger. A technically efficient lifter strives
                            to use the first strategy as much as the second.
                        </li>
                        <li>Most people think the bar needs to be lifted higher than is actually necessary
                            than is actually required to get under a clean or snatch.
                        </li>
                        <li>One reason is due to fear: you instinctively want to give yourself an extra
                            margin of error to get under.
                        </li>
                        <li>A second reason is inadequate body awareness; you may underestimate how high the bar is relative to your
                            actual height.
                        </li>
                        <li>A third reason is incorrect timing. You may rebend your legs late, so the bar starts to decelerate before
                            you can actually get under.
                        </li>

                        <li>The large jumps are meant to cause neurological adaptation from psychological stress.</li>
                        <li>They also prepare you for long waits in competition, when you might have to take
                            lighter warmup sets in between your heavy attempts on the platform. If you don't 
                            practice large jumps, then you will be forced to take heavy lifts during you long waits,
                            which can use up energetic reserves that are better saved for maximal attempts on the platform.
                        </li>
                        <li>Large jumps also force you to concentrate more, so that you learn to maintain consistent technique
