                    <h4>Pause Front Squat 10 secs 3x3</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This exercise is primarily to warm up
                            up your bottom position for the next exercise.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Perform that descent at a moderate speed, pause 10 secs at bottom,
                            then recover quickly.
                        </li>

                    <h4>Tempo Front Squat 10 secs + 3 bounces 5x3</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Descend slowly to within a few centimeters of
                            rock bottom (which you should have found in the previous
                            exercise).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When you are within a few centimeters of rock
                            bottom, allow your legs to relax suddenly so that
                            you free fall to bottom position (hamstrings on calves),
                            then bounce up.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Rather than stand back up immediately out of the bounce,
                            relax, then bounce up to a height less than half way to parallel two more times.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            On the third bounce, stand back up.
                        </li>
                        <li>3 bounces + 1 recovery = 1 rep</li>
                        <li>Use only enough weight to find your bounce. This is not
                            a strength or conditioning exercise.
                        </li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Tempo Halting Snatch Deadlift 10/10/10 5x2</h4>
                    Find your snatch start position, then stand up until
                    the bar touches your hips. 10 seconds up, 10 seconds pause in halting position,
                    10 seconds lowering back to start.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your center of gravity should remain constant from start
                            to finish (especially avoid drifting into your heels)
                        </li>
                        <li>The bar should lightly brush your legs from start to finish</li>
                        <li>Your arms and upper back should remain passive the entire
                            movement (it is a dead hang), but you must maintain your back arch
                            and open chest.
                        </li>
                        <li>In the finish (halting) position, your knees should still be slightly bent and 
                            the bar should be plumb below the rear of your armpit. The bar should
                            remain touching the articulation point of your hips.
                        </li>

                    <h4>Snatch Grip Push Press Behind the Neck 5x5 w/5 secs hold</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You may go fairly heavy on this exercise as long as you
                            can hold the weight stable overhead for five seconds
                            on the final rep of each set.
                        </li>
                        <li>If you start to lose your balance or cannot keep your arms
                            locked out for five seconds on the last rep of a set, reduce the weight.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                    <h4>Drop squat warm up (body only) for 30 seconds</h4>

                <li>
                    <h4>Muscle snatch + Overhead Squat + Good morning snatch balance 5x3</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You should be fairly tired from the push presses so that you
                            will naturally use light weights on this exercise
                        </li>
                        <li>The muscle snatch should be performed with a light touch of your hips (not
                            all muscle snatches are performed like this variation)
                        </li>
                        <li>After recovering from the squat, lower the bar to your back, then
                            comments the G.M.S.B.

                <li>
                    <h4>Tall Snatch 5x3</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start the movement with your heels 1 mm off the ground,
                            quads and glutes flexed as tight as possible until you
                            feel a little burn.
                        </li>
                        <li>Commence the movement by relaxing your knee joint and
                            lifting the point of your elbow directly to the ceiling
                            at the exact same moment.
                        </li>
                        <li>Try to drop to rock bottom without slowing yourself down.</li>
                        <li>It is an error to give yourself even the slightest boost / bounce up
                            when commencing the movement. The purpose of the hard flex
                            is to make it easier to commence the movement by just relaxing your
                            legs like someone secretly pulled a chair out from undernearth you when 
                            you started to sit down.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                    <h4><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqPvGYaVnhA">Clean Rack Delivery</a> 4x5</h4>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Tall Clean 5x3</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Commence this movement exactly like the tall snatch.</li>
                        <li>Since your hands start closer together, it is more difficult
                            (less natural) to move your elbows correctly. You have to
                            deliberately move your elbows WIDE and HIGH before you
                            turn over the bar into rack position.
                        </li>
                        <li>The clean is not a fast reverse curl. In a reverse curl,
                            the bar rotates around your body with your elbows locked in place as the fulcrum.
                            In a clean, you lift your elbows high, and *the bar is the fulcrum* as your
                            elbows rotate around the bar, and you make full use of the bearings in the collar.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Press Behind the Next in Jerk Split with Cheat 5x5</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>On each rep, boost the weight overhead with a small 
                            jump into the air from split position. The jump should not be so aggressive
                            that you lose your balance and cannot land with your
                            feet in the same split position that you started with.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Drop Split 5x3</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Not to be confused with the drop jerk.</li>
                        <li>Place the bar on your back, and leave it there for
                            the entire movement; your arms are not involved in this
                            exercise, other than to keep the bar placed on your
                            back as they would when you squat.
                        </li>
                        <li>Start standing tall with your quads and glutes flexed, and
                            heels 1 mm off of the ground.
                        </li>
                        <li>Without boosting yourself up even the tiniest bit,
                            (i.e., no cheating), drop into your jerk split.
                        </li>
                        <li>Add as much weight as you like as you get comfortable, and 
                            use a belt if necessary.</li>
                        <li>This is an exercise in speed, timing, and accuracy. Adding
                            weight provides an intimidation factor, but you never actually
                            "lift" the weight. It will, however, be more difficult to
                            stop yourself from going lower in the split.
                        </li>
                        <li>Remember, gravity is a constant, so the speed that you need to move
                            your feet into the split remains the same regardless of the
                            amount of weight you put on your back. If you don't get your
                            feet into the proper split, it is usually because you mis-timed
                            when to start moving them.
